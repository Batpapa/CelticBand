INTRO 

COUPLET HARMONICA SEUL
REFRAIN HARMONICA + GUITARE


I've been a wild rover for many's the year
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store 
And I never will play the wild rover no more

[REFRAIN] + BEN CHANT

I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me "nay"
"Such a custom as yours I can have every day"

COUPLET CHANT EMILY SEUL : + BEN HARMONICA

I then took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She says "I have whiskeys and wines of the best"
And the words that you tolt me were only in jest

[REFRAIN] + BEN HARMONICA

COUPLET CHANT EMILY SEUL

I'll home to my parents, confess what I'd done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they've caressed me as ofttimes before
I never will play the wild rover no more

[REFRAIN] + BEN CHANT
